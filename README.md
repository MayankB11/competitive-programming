Contest-Solutions
=================

A collection of my own contest solutions for varying contests. Please disregard any coding covention that should be present in my code, these were supposed to be made 'quick and dirty' like they would be in a contest. My solutions are primarily written in C++, the others are mostly written in Java.

These are most of the problems that I have solved, if anyone would like to know a full list of problems that I have solved or would like to request a solution to be uploaded(from this same list), then please follow the link provided below.
