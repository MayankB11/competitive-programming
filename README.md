Contest-Solutions
=================

My contest solutions for varying contests. Please disregard any coding covention that should be present in my submissions, these were supposed to be made 'quick and dirty' like they would be in a contest. My submissions are primarily written in C++.These are only some of the problems that I have solved, if anyone would like to know a full set of problems that I have solved please follow the link below.
